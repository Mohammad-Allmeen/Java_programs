/*
// Java collection frameworks are stored in the form of interface which is implemented by Collection and this colllection contains
three vital data strcuture - which is List, Queue, and Set

Now question is if they are interface how will be used as for interface we caanot create object, therefore we use them in the form of 
Classes

Major method which are used in Collection framework are-
1- add()
2. size
3. remove
4. iterate
5. addAll
6. removeAll
7. clear 


LIST Interface

List contains these major data structure classes those are-
1. ArrayList
2. LinkedList
3. Vector - Vector class is similar and indentical to linked however the Vector has advanatge which is they are thread safe 
4. Stack


QUEUE Interface

Queue works on FIFO order(the one who comes first his work will be done first and he will depart first)

Queue contains these major data structure classes those are-

1. Prority Queue - there is priority set for the some queue member
2. Linked List
3. Deque- Double ended queue, usually in queue members are added form behind or rear end. However in Deque from both front and behind the members can be added 


SET Interface 

Set is a classes that consist or stores unique set of objects

Queue contains these major data structure classes those are-

1. HashSet
2. LinkedHashSet- all the elements are connected 
3. Sorted Set
4. Tree Set


MAP Interface 

Map consist elments in the form of Key-value form

Map contains these major data structure classes those are-

1. HashMap
2. LinkedHashMap
3. TreeMap
4. SortedMap
5. HashTable


Using these above interfaces, classes and method we implement Tree and Graphs in Java, there is no inbuild resouces
