// Bit manipulation is performed to change modify or know the bits
/* There are 4 operations in Bit Manipulation-  
 * 1. get- to get the bit of that particular position
 * 2. set- to set the bit at particular location or positions
 * 3. clear- to make all the bit as zero then we will use clear 
 * 4. update- to change or modify the bit from one to zero and from zero to one
 * 
 * 
 * 1. GET BIT OPERATION-
 * For this process we create a bit mask- 
 * for example the Number is (0101) thereafterr you will take 1(0001) and shift it to particular position given in the question for example 2
 * so 1<<2(1lest shift by 2-> 0100) this 0100 is called Bit Mask and  thereafter we perform AND operation with this and the given Number
 * AND Opearation between 0101 and 0100 will provide the ans as 0100 
 * Now if the answer is non-zero(0100) therefore the bit that we want to get is 1 but if the AND operation results in zero(0000) then
 * the bit that we want to get is 0
 * 
 * NOTE- the logic behid this is as you know the AND operation results only to one when both the numbers are 1
 * if in that partuclar position meaning third place(0101) if the number is 1 then the AND operation 
 * between 0101 and 0100 will result in one otherwise all will be zero
