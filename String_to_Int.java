// Normal variable are created in stack and and as String are immutable for every change in the string a new String will be created 
// Wheres in StringBuilder the stack wil point to the same String object and if any modificatuon are done it will be added to that string 
//it will not create new String this process safe the time which is very efficient and useful technique for large String based projects

        // then it will return not equal no matter if the value or string are equal because the non-primitive datatype qare stored in different location that is in the heap memory 

        //EXAMPLE

        if(new String("Allmeen")== new String("Allmeen")){

        }else{
            System.out.println("String are not equal"); // Output you will get as Strings are not equal as the String are stored by the non primitive datatype which is store as the object in the heap memory
